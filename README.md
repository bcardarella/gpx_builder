# Mass Bay, Hingham Bay, and Salem Bay racing mark GPX builder

This script is written in Elixir. To run:

```cmd
> elixir generator.exs
```

The generated GPX files will be in `output/`

You can use these GPX files to populate waypoints in your Chartplotter.

This was hacked together in a day. Code quality reflects that, but it works.
